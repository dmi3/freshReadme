# Fresh Readme

Keep source code examples in your readme fresh!

## What is it?

This is simple Markdown preprocessor which updates examples from source code files.

If included files are compiled and verified on project build phase, it will help avoid a shameful situation when examples in readme are outdated.

Suggested usage is Git [pre commit hook](#automation).

## Motivation

It might be useful to you:

* As preprocessor if your markdown-to-html solution does not support includes
    - For example [Github README renderer](https://github.com/dmi3/freshReadme/#readme)
* If you don't want to use markdown-to-html solution at all

Benefits comparing with [existing solutions](#alternative-solutions):

* Examples are updated in Markdown file not in resulting html, so default readme on Github or people who open Markdown file will get up to date examples
* Source is refreshed in one Markdown file, so you don't need to keep duplicated `README.source.md` and `README.source.md`
* Allows to include *only part* of source file, to show only meaningful part of code skipping initialization and verification
* Includes source surrounded by specially formatted comments, not line numbers so if you change source code file, you don't need update includes in readme
* Include source language agnostic - you can include any language that supports comments
* Automatic indentation removal

## How to use

* In `README.md`:
    - Put `<!-- [freshReadmeSource](path/to/file.ext) -->` before &grave;&grave;&grave; to include `path/to/file.ext`
    - Put `<!-- [freshReadmeSource](path/to/file.ext#snippetName) -->` before &grave;&grave;&grave; to include text surrounded by `snippetName` in `path/to/file.ext`
* `freshreadme` without arguments will update "README.md" located in current directory
* `freshreadme path/to/file.md` will update `file.md`

## Example

For example `README.md`:

<!-- [freshReadmeSource](examples/README.md.example) -->
```markdown
    # Regular expressions

    In Java

    <!-- [freshReadmeSource](examples/Examples.java#snippet1) -->
    ```java
    // This will be overwritten from examples/Examples.java
    ```

    In Python

    <!-- [freshReadmeSource](examples/examples.py#snippet2) -->
    ```python
    # This will be overwritten from examples/examples.py
    ```
```

And `examples/java.java` (note that indentation will be removed to start at first characher at first string):

<!-- [freshReadmeSource](examples/Examples.java) -->
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

public class Examples {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void example1() throws Exception {

        // freshReadmeSnippet: snippet1
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("[a-z]+");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("abc cde fgf");

        ArrayList<String> matches = new ArrayList<>();
        while (matcher.find()) {
            matches.add(matcher.group());
        }
        // freshReadmeSnippet: snippet1

        assertThat(matches).containsExactly("abc", "cde", "fgf");

    }
}

```

After running `freshreadme`, `README.md` [will be updated](examples/README.md.result).

## Installation

* Download [latest release](https://github.com/dmi3/freshreadme/releases)
* Or clone repository and [build Go project](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Command)

## Automation

[Install freshReadme](#installation), then create a [Git Hook](https://git-scm.com/book/gr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.

âš  Note that this applies only to *previously committed* files with `.md` extension to avoid committing and modifying untracked files.

<!-- [freshReadmeSource](examples/pre-commit) -->
```sh
#!/bin/bash

for f in $(git ls-files "*.md"); do
  freshReadme "$f"
  git add "$f"
done
```

## Alternative solutions

* [okreadme](https://github.com/wan2land/okreadme) requires to keep duplicate files - `README.ok.md` and `README.md`
* [Apache Maven Site Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-snippet-macro.html) works only in Java and mvn ecosystem, allows including files to resulting html
